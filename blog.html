<h1>30th of November 2017</h1>
<p>First entry.</p>



<h1>3rd of December 2017</h1>
<p>Reading <i>"Measuring the degeneracy of discrete energy levels using a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum
dot by Hofmann et al." </i>:
What is "detailed balance"?</p>
 
<p>I went over the paper. Still need to really understand everything and be able to answer the questions in the exercise.</p>



<h1>8th of December 2017</h1>
<p>Ok..back to the problem set:</p>

<p> 1- What is the Stark effect?: It's an energy splitting due to an applied electric field which pulls electrons and the nuclei to which they are attached in different directions. This has the effect that an electronic state in which the electron tends to reside more on the left of the nucleus, it will have a lower energy than an electron that tends to reside on the right. What does this have to do with the paper? The authors of the paper propose a technique of measure the different kinds of degeneracies without lifting them. The experiments focus on spin-degeneracy.</p>

<p> 2- Draw a circuit diagram of the set-up in Fig. 1a, with all voltage sources, current meters, and ground: I will be able to answer this one more easily after I understand how the experiment works exactly; will come back to it later...</p>

<p> 3- Why is the measured current in Fig. 1b for the (N-1) occupation greater than for the N occupation?: So when an extra electron is on the dot, the current through the quantum point contact (QPC) is lower. A QPC is just a current channel that we can make narrower by varying the voltage of the top gates defining it. In this case, we can think of the quantum dot as one of the top gates. When an extra electron is on the dot, it makes the channel narrower because it repels the electrons under it.  So there you go. That's what happens qualitatively. Can we make it more quantitative? We always can; but is it worth it?</p>

<p> 4- In a traditional measurement set-up, in which the current through the quantum dot is measured directly, the noise limits the sensitivity of the measurement, with 30fA usually considered to be the lower limit. Why can the guys in this paper measure a much smaller current? [Hint: for 100fA how many electrons move through the dot per second, i.e., what is the corresponding tunneling rate?]: In Fig. 1b, they measure 1.46nA when the dot is empty and 1.21nA when the dot has an electron on it. Where is fA? Let's answer the question in the hint, first. I = Ne/t = 100fA. This gives a tunnelling rate (\(\Gamma\) ?) N/t of 624150.9647 electrons per second. Oh..I see. In Fig. 2, they measure a tunneling rate on the order of a few tens of electrons per second, which corresponds to a tunneling current of 6.4aA. Ok. How do they do that? Obviously by using a QPC, but how does it work?...How would one measure the current going through the quantum dot directly? Putting between two leads ofcourse! How does thermal noise make that not work well? Is it because thermal energy makes electrons tunnel from one lead to another (direct tunnelling), or is it because thermal energy makes the electrons jump on the dot and out even when the level is not in the bias window, or is it a combination of both? This makes the number of in-tunnelling and out-tunnelling electrons blurred. Using a QPC -- with which we can detect the presence of a single electron --, however, the in-tunnelling and out-tunnelling current does not get obscured by thermal current that gives us no clue about the tunnelling ratios.</p>

<p> 5- Consider zero magnetic field. What are the three important energy scales in this experiment, and which of them is the largest? Why is it important that that energy scale be the largest in the experiment?: Charging energy, confinement energy, and thermal energy (?). Charging energy is around 1meV, which is much larger than the thermal energy in this experiment. This is necessary for maintaining the single electron tunneling regime. Estimating the confinement energy as planck's constant ^2 / (  (2* 0.06 * electron mass)  ) * (1 / 1000nm)^2 / electron charge = 25ueV, we say that the charging energy is the largest of the three.</p>

<p> 6- Explain the measuring principle behind this measurement set-up? What is the role of the QPC?: Electrons are flowing through the QPC. When an electron jumps on the dot, the current through the QPC drops sharply (if it's biased right...I should review the slides on the QPC to complete this answer...Also I should explain how the feedback mechanism works.).</p>

<p> 7- Looking at Fig. 2, explain where the factor of 2 difference between in-tunneling current and out-tunnelling current comes from.:In the top-rightmost plot in Fig. 2, in-tunnelling current is twice as high as out-tunnelling current. This is because the lowest orbital can accomodate two electrons with opposite spin (spin singlet), so an electron will be twice as likely to tunnel onto the dot that if there were only place for one electron.</p> 



<h1>10th of December 2017</h1>
<p>As for the out-tunnelling current, the measurement in the paper is set up such that as soon as an electron tunnels in, the gate voltage is raised (through a feedback mechanism), and the it stays up until the electron on the dot jumps out. The out-tunnelling for the first level is small because only one electron is going to jump out. This results in the 2:1 ratio seen in the upper leftmost plot in Fig. 2. Now, when we add the second electron, it will land in the ground state, with a spin that is opposite to the spin of the electron already on the dot. The ground state, which can accomodate two electrons, already has one electron in it, and so has room for one more, i.e., the probability that an electron will tunnel is halved from when we were adding the first electron. As soon as the second electron jumps on, the feedback mechanism raises the gate energy and waits for the electrons to tunnel out. There are two of them so an electrons is twice as likley to tunnel out that it was to tunnel in, hence the 1:2 ratio between in-tunnelling and out-tunnelling current.</p>

<p> 8- What is the weak linear energy dependence mention in the paper?: From Fig. 2, we see that the tunneling rates are not constant as we vary the energy near the extremes. For a quantum dot with sharply defined energy levels, one would expect the tunneling rates to be constant: if the energy of the dot falls below that of the source, an electron will tunnel in with a certain probability that does not depend on how far below the source energy the dot energy is; and if dot energy goes above the drain energy, an electron will tunnel out with a certain probability, not matter how far above the drain energy the dot energy is. Where does the energy dependence come from, then? It comes from the fact that the tunnelling rate depends exponentially on the energy of the electron on and off the dot (Vds and Vgs), as can be seen from the WKB formula. For small variatons in the energies, the depends can be approximated by a linear model, which can be seen in the paper.</p>

<p> 9- What happens when we turn on a magnetic field? And how can this be seen from Fig. 3?: The spin degeneracy will be lifted, with a Zeeman energy splitting. This can be seen from Fig. 3 by seeing that at small negative energies, an electron is as likely to tunnel as it is to tunnel out, indicating that the lowest level can accomodate only one electron (with a spin parallel to the magnetic field). When the energy is made more negative such that the excited Zeeman level goes below the source energy, there is room for two electrons to tunnel in, which manifests as a two-fold increase in the in-tunneling rate.</p>

<p>------------------</p>

<p>Ok...on to something else.</p>



<h1>11th of December 2017</h1>
<p>I have had this picture for a while: quantum superposition comes from the inability (may be because otherwise something bad will happen -- in the same sense that an excited ion in a cavity does not emit a photon until the cavity is tuned to the right length, otherwise the photon will not fit in the cavity) of nature to distinguish between two states of something; like spin up or spin down of an electron, or horizontal electric field or vertical electric field of a photon, or right slit or left slit in a double-slit experiment. So what would go wrong with the universe if there were no superposition? Or...why is the universe unable to distinguish between the two states in a superposition?</p>

<p>There was this tweet that suggested that Sean Carroll endorses the idea that superposition comes from a universal limit on the transfer of information. This goes along the same lines of my thinking, so I am going to assume it's true for the sake of argument. There is a trend: things that can be in superpositon have a small mass (not small size <although small size might be making them more immune from interactions with the environment>), which is consistent with DeBorglie's matter wave idea \(\lambda = {h \over p} \); things that are observed to be in a superposition are ones that do not interact with too much stuff around them (collectively referred to as "the environment");</p>

<h1>12th of December 2017</h1>
<p>An excited ion cannot relax in a cavity if the length is not an integer multiple of half the photon wavelength, because the photon will not fit. The photon cannot exist in the cavity so it will not be emitted. Now...an electron cannot go through a double-slit apparatus without being in a superposition. Before being observed, the electron cannot exist unless it's in a superposition. Why? What doesn't fit? What deadly fate is nature protecting the electron from?</p>

<p>Nature to itself when the excited-ion-in-a-cavity experiment is run: "No way I am going to let you emit that photon! The cavity length is not right! If I were a bouncer guarding the entrance of this cavity, I would never let that photon in. So you, ion, will NOT emit it."</p>

<p>Nature to itselft when an electron is going through a single slit: "Ok, electron. People would think that I would just let you land right infront of the slit. Unfortunately, your mass is too small, so [loud noise from a nearby construction site], and that's why I can't let you land in exactly one spot. You will have to diffract like a wave (but still land on a single spot on the detector screen)."</p>

<p>Me trying to guess what nature said: the electron mass is too small so...Does it have to do with the speed of light being the maximum speed of information transfer?...It's something that is affected by mass, because a more massive particle would not have to diffract as much an electron...What is the worst that could happen if the electron did not diffract? What forbidden thing would happen?</p>

<p>A photon has no mass, but its diffraction after a narrow slit can be varied by changing the photon's energy. So this is not stricly about mass. It is about energy...A photon still lands on a single spot on a detector screen after passing through a narrow slit. Will an electron with the same energy as a photon of a certain frequency diffract in exactly the same way? Well, wavelength is what determines how much a wave will diffract. Assuming that DeBroglie's formula is accurate, that means that for an electron wavelength \(\lambda_e\) and a photon wavelength \( \lambda_p \) to be equal, we must have \( {hc \over E} = {hc^2 \over E v_e}\). This equation only holds for \(v_e = c\), which is never true for an object with mass, which means that total energy is not everything; the momentum of the electron also matters. This doesn't look right, does it? For the photon I used \(\lambda_p = {hc \over E_p}  \), and for the electron I used \( \lambda_e = {h \over \gamma m_0 v} = {hc^2 \over E_e v}\). But this means that an electron will always have a longer wavelength as a photon, which I know is not true. Will come back to it later. In any case, we know that for photons, we can vary the diffraction by varying the frequency, and that the photon will always land on a single spot on a detector screen.</p>

<p>The question is now "why does a single photon diffract?" (Does an observed photon still diffract at a narrow slit? ... Does an observed electron still diffract? I think not, so neither should a photon.)</p>



<h1>13th of December 2017</h1>

So...why do I seem so convinced that a photon is at its core a particle, albeit one that nature forces to behave like a wave (when it is isolated from interactions with the
 environment) for some reason. The short answer is that its a hunch. Of course it's a hunch. But here is how that hunch came to grow. It started with the following gedanken
 experiment: suppose we have two balls of steel the size of earth on a collision course in deep space. Suppose now that you have a camera that can take a snapshot of the
 scene, just before the balls collide. The camera does not capture photons, but rather works by detecting the gravitational disturbance of the balls on spacetime. How can
 someone who is given the picture of the gravometric disturbance around the balls at a single moment in time determine whether the balls are going to undergo a massive
 collision, or are just going to sit there? The answer is that he/she can check whether there are doppler-like spacetime compressions around the balls, and if there are
 compressions, use them to determine their velocities relative to a stationary observer, and consequently their energies, and whether they are going to smash into each
 other or not. The smaller the momentum of either of the steel balls is, the less compressed spacetime in its direction of motion will be. Now take one of the balls and
 slow it down just enough for it to have a deBroglie wavelength long enough that the ball will exhibit diffraction at a slit that has a width equal to its diameter
 (steel might not be the material at which that is possible...it might be worthwhile to calculate the required density of the ball. Might have to be a blackhole! 
Exciting! Anything with "blackhole" in it is exciting. EDIT: the bigger the ball, the less dense it will have to be [\( \rho = {6h \over \pi d^4 v} \), where d is the
 diameter of the ball and v its velocity; this calculation is for \( \lambda = d\)]). Now, at that momentum value, what is the length scale of the spacetime compressions?
 Is it on the order of magnitude of some famous length scale in quantum information theory?</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that spacetime compressions are relative, i.e., they change from reference frame to another. That means we can control the wavelength
 of the ball as it goes through the slit by making the slit move with a constant velocity towards the ball in space (what happens in the slit accelerates?). If the slit
 is moving towards the ball too fast, the deBroglie wavelength of the ball, as seen by the slit, will be too short for diffraction.</p>

<p>Here's another thread of thought: imagine we take one of the steel balls and make sure, to the best of our abilities (we can not interact with it, otherwise its
 quantum state will collapse), that it is has 0 velocity. From a snapshot using the gravometric camera we used earlier, noone, including nature, can ever tell where
 the ball will go next, because it's not moving. Now let's consider the same ball but now it has a huge momentum (very short wavelength). We know more or less exactly
 where it's going. Even as it passes a narrow slit, it will not diffract very much. Now...why did we assume that these two are the only states of knowledge (not
 knowing at all where the ball will go next, and knowing more or less exactly where it will go next) that we can have about the system? Why did we assume that
 the states of knowledge that we can have about the system is not a continuum?</p>

<p>For a stationary ball, we cannot tell where it will go next. For a ball with very high momentum, we can tell exactly where it will go next. Assuming that the
 possible knowledge that we can gain about the system is a continuum, then the following is valid for a ball with tiny momentum: whatever knowledge that we can
 gain about the ball without disturbing it in any way will only tell us that that ball will travel in the direction of its tiny velocity, BUT it might not travel
 exactly in that direction; it could go a bit left, or a bit right. </p>



<h1>15th of December 2017</h1>

<p>So in quantum crypto class today there was a discussion about how strong extractors can help Alice amplify her privacy when sending a key to Bob when a Eve is
 evesdropping. If Eve intercepts some of the bits (decreases the min-entropy of the message Alice sends to Bob), then Alice and Bob can use a strong extractor to
 render the bits Eve intercepted almost useless (re-boost the min-entropy). Can we plot how the min-entropy increases if we use strong extractors (with a variable
 length of the key)?</p>



<h1>24th of December 2017</h1>

<p>Ok..I am now going to say stuff that make sense to me -- and sometimes even ones that don't seem very solid. I am not going to read about them to see if they are
 really true. I am just going to throw things out there. It's almost going to be all nonsense, but it helps me think to write it down anyway:</p>

<p>When I think whether classical theories have any of that "it's that way because it can't exist any other way, I can't find a lot." A paricle not going a certain way
 because if a wave went that way it would interfere and die. That doesn't happen in classical physics. An ion in a cavity not emitting a photon because an emitted photon
 wouldn't fit. That doesn't happen in classical physics. It sounds a bit like retrocausality.</p>

<p>May be we got the double slit experiment the other way around: the wave behavior happens because particles on the quantum level behave a certain way, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Suppose that light can travel instantaneously. Would we have ever discovered entanglement? Well, we could have made an entangled pair of electrons, shot one of them
 into a sealed chamber, and did the measurements. Would we have found them to be entangled? </p>

<p>Suppose that light can travel instantaneously. How would the electron double slit experiment been different? </p>

<p>Quantum superposition is nature's way of avoiding a universe-breaking paradox.</p>

<p>If local operations on quantum states allowed us to vary the amount of entanglement in a joint state, then faster-than-light communication would be possible, because
 two parties playing the CHSH game would be able to vary their winning probability by applying different local gates (?) But why can't one party choose a bad angle and
 communicate information through the winning probability? I am missing something.</p>



<h1>25th of December 2017</h1>

<p>I need to read more about Planck scales, and whether they have ever been connected to something in quantum information theory.</p>

<p>Before, I was talking black holes slowing down enough such that their deBroglie wavelength is equal to their diameter. Also, I was thinking about how superposition,
 and hence interference patterns for single particles, are due to some fundamental limit in the universe. A connection between the two ideas (with the universal limit
 being the speed of light) is the Schwarzschild radius: \(r_S = {2GM \over c^2}\)</p>



<h1>26th of December 2017</h1>

<p>I should also think about an electron in an infinite square well.</p>



<h1>6th of January 2018</h1>
<p> Let's assume for the time being that the process of collapsing a quantum state is only concerned with the information we gain, and not with things like the kick
 a photon gives an electron going through a double slit. </p>

<p>Now, an infinite square well..: The smaller the well, the higher the energy levels and the more separated they are. A particle in a 1D square well has some energy.
 If we think classically, it can do nothing with that energy other than go back and forth, bouncing off the walls of the well. A particle in the first excited state is less
 likley to exist right in the middle of the well than anywhere else (with point right in the middle of the well where the particle can never exist). Why would the universe
 crash if the ball existed right in the middle? What universal limit would be violated? It might be worth keeping in the mind that the more the energy a particle has the more
 detectable it is from a space-time snapshot.</p>

<p>"Look..it's a ball alright. I can't see it very well from my snapshots. That's why I have to do this probability stuff. And I can't say that it's right in the center
 (first energy level), or the universe will crash."</p>

<p>I forgot to think about speed limits! Next time.</p>



<h1>7th of January 2018</h1>

<p>I also need to learn a bit of general relativity now.</p>



<h1>11th of January 2018</h1>

<p>Take an infinite square well with length L, then suddenly expand the length to 2L. In the unexpanded well, the ground state had an energy E0. In the expanded well,
 the ground state energy is lower. After the expansion, a particle that was in the ground state in the old well will now not exactly fit in the new well,
 so it will exist in a superpostion of all the energy levels of the new well...until its energy is measured and collapses to one of them (the energy difference
 is siphoned or provided by the measurement apparatus). Before the measurement, the particle isn't in any of the energy levels of the new well. It cannot be,
 or energy conservation would be violated. Do superposition come from conservation laws?</p>



<h1>15th of January 2018</h1>

<p>I mentioned before that for a stationary and moving ball, we assumed that transition from ignorance of where the ball will go to knowing where it will go
 should not be as discrete as we have been assuming so far (classically), and that it is actually possible that the transition is analog -- a smooth function
 of the ball's momentum. What can that function be?</p>



<h1>22nd of January 2018</h1>

<p>I need to write down my interpretation of entanglement swapping.</p>



<h1>23rd of January 2018</h1>

<p>I need to think about how to design cool quantum algorithms (see Leo Dicarlo's slide, week 4).</p>



<h1>13th of February 2018 </h1>

<p>Suddenly expanding a chamber with classical particles does what to the energy?</p>

<p>Energy superpositon comes from the energy conservation law. Spin superpostion comes from the angular momentum conservation law. And so on ... .
 Superposition comes into existance when the quantity in consideration does not fit in any of the allowed (quantized) values of the system. For example,
 energy superposition happens when an electron that was in a potential well suddenly -- through the expansion of the well -- finds its energy to not be one of
 the allowed energies of the well. If we assume that this is really where superposition comes from, then the more appropriate question is where the quantizations
 come from. I have to review some stuff.</p>



<h1>18th of February 2018 </h1>

<p>Possible approach: First, we must have an idea for a grand experiment we would want to do if we had a large quantum computer. Then, we will know how to make
 a large quantum computer in a cool way.</p>



<h1>3rd of March 2018 </h1>

<p>Since a while, I have been losing grades here and there in quizes and exams for reasons that have nothing to do with how intelligent or capable I am. Since grades
 have an effect on the impression a potential supervisor gets on competency, I have decided that it would be clever to keep a record of the points I lose for reasons
 that a supervisor would see as undeniably uncorrelated with my competency. I am currently a first year masters student at TU Delft. Below is the record:</p>

<p> Quantum Hardware: -2 points on quiz 3 for not looking in the lecture notes before the quiz and reading that a condition on the Lindblad equation is that the system
 be Markovian, and that 2T1 = T2 in the ideal case. </p>



<h1>22rd of March 2018 </h1>

<p> Feynman said that if one goes deep enough into thinking about a problem, one can end discovering something new. I am efficient at navigating through a problem and learning quickly
. So, I think I am going to operate in two modes now: 1-skim through new papers and arxiv profiles to know what is going on. 2- 
take an idea and really think about it, and really ask around till you end up knowing that the problem has a known solution, or till you
end up with a problem that noone's knows the solution to, at which point continue digging deeper and teasing people around you into thinking about a solution with you.</p>

<p>And when you do have an idea, don't wait around. Get to work right away. "Fail fast." Stackexchange.com is good for that.</p>



<h1>29th of March 2018 </h1>
<p> The idea that superposition follows from the conservation of energy seems to have been a brainfart. Take a particle in the ground state of an infinite square well with length \(L\).
Now expand the well suddenly to length \(2L\). The first excited level of the new well has exactly the same energy as the particle. Although energy conservation would not be violated if
if the particle settled in the first excited level of the new well, it doesn't. So superposition is there eventhough energy conservation is not in danger.</p>

<p> Also, a minor proofing of an idea I mentioned earlier (space-time compression): If an object is emitting gravitational waves and moving in a certain direction, we can calculate its
velocity from a snapshot by laying small masses in its path and observing the doppler shift -- acting on the masses infront of and behind the moving object -- caused by the motion. </p>



<h1>5th of April 2018 </h1>
<p>The (k,n) threshold quantum-secret sharing scheme, in which no less than k parties can recover any information about the shared secret (at least k parties must come together to recover all
the informtion) is interesting. Is this related to the concept of quantum information locking used in Smolin et al.'s "Locking Information in Black Holes"?/p>

<p> Also, I should read more about the connection between quantum-secret sharing and quantum error correction. Cleve's "How to share a quantum secret" explores that. </p>



<h1>6th of April 2018 </h1>
<p>"Ironically, if we had a quantum computer we would be able to do that."
Well, may be we should start really trying to design a quantum computer that does
"that", and we would be able to, both, build a quantum computer and do "that".</p>



<h1>14th of April 2018 </h1>
<p>Pure GHZ states can be transformed approximately into pure W states, probabillistically; the converse is not true (Acin, Bruss, Lewenstein, and Sanpera 2001). </p>

<p>Ofcourse superposition happens because the universe protecting some physical law. What I conjecture is that it is a law that we 
already know. </p>



<h1>23th of April 2018 [Seeing if it is possible to use machine learning to find a squashing channel that gives a tight upper bound on the squashed
 entanglement]</h1>
<p>Ok, so from now on I am going to title my blog entry based on content in addition to dating them. This way I can build on previous entries by adding 
edits to them.</p>

<p>Calculating the squashed entanglement of a state is NP-hard (Huang 2013). In (K. Goodenough et al. 2016), tight upper bounds on squashed entanglement of
channels were explored by picking a fixed squashing channel (they use primarily the identity squashing channel). Is it possible to use a machine learning 
model to find a squashing channel that results in a tighter bound than those resulting from the squashing channels in (K. Goodenough et al. 2016)?</p>

<p>Finding a good squashing channel is an optimization problem. Since it is provably an NP-Hard problem, the best you can do is do an inefficient search
for a good squashing channel; and you would have to do this for every channel you want to calculate the squashed entanglement for.</p>

<p>[EDIT 24/4/2018] I am considering using a genetic algorithm. A problem-specific optimization algorithm probably does not exist, as far as I understand.
I am not sure. I am going to see if I can do it using a genetic algorithm anyway. It sounds cool.</p>

<p>[EDIT 3/5/2018] Ok, so the genetic algorithm successfully broke the upper bound on the state in page 4 of (Christandl and Winter 2003). It was 
very cool to see it do that. Next up: try to see if the Holevo bound can be surpassed. Also, It would be cool to see what the circuit corresponding
to the unitary evolved \(U_{EF}\) in the code looks like: are parts of the circuit fixed for any unitary that returns the squashed entanglement? 
The optimization problem is NP-hard. What does that mean for the circuit representation of the unitary?</p>
