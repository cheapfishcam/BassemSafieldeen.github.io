<h1>30th of November 2017</h1>
<p>First entry.</p>


<h1>3rd of December 2017</h1>
<p>Reading <i>"Measuring the degeneracy of discrete energy levels using a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum
dot by Hofmann et al." </i>:
What is "detailed balance"? </p>
 
<p>I went over the paper. Still need to really understand everything and be able to answer the questions in the exercise.</p>

<h1>8th of December 2017</h1>
<p>Ok..back to the problem set: </p>

<p> 1- What is the Stark effect?: It's an energy splitting due to an applied electric field which pulls electrons and the nuclei to which they are attached in different directions. This has the effect that an electronic state in which the electron tends to reside more on the left of the nucleus, it will have a lower energy than an electron that tends to reside on the right. What does this have to do with the paper? The authors of the paper propose a technique of measure the different kinds of degeneracies without lifting them. The experiments focus on spin-degeneracy.</p>

<p> 2- Draw a circuit diagram of the set-up in Fig. 1a, with all voltage sources, current meters, and ground: I will be able to answer this one more easily after I understand how the experiment works exactly; will come back to it later... </p>

<p> 3- Why is the measured current in Fig. 1b for the (N-1) occupation greater than for the N occupation?: So when an extra electron is on the dot, the current through the quantum point contact (QPC) is lower. A QPC is just a current channel that we can make narrower by varying the voltage of the top gates defining it. In this case, we can think of the quantum dot as one of the top gates. When an extra electron is on the dot, it makes the channel narrower because it repels the electrons under it.  So there you go. That's what happens qualitatively. Can we make it more quantitative? We always can; but is it worth it? </p>

<p> 4- In a traditional measurement set-up, in which the current through the quantum dot is measured directly, the noise limits the sensitivity of the measurement, with 30fA usually considered to be the lower limit. Why can the guys in this paper measure a much smaller current? [Hint: for 100fA how many electrons move through the dot per second, i.e., what is the corresponding tunneling rate?]: In Fig. 1b, they measure 1.46nA when the dot is empty and 1.21nA when the dot has an electron on it. Where is fA? Let's answer the question in the hint, first. I = Ne/t = 100fA. This gives a tunnelling rate (\(\Gamma\) ?) N/t of 624150.9647 electrons per second. Oh..I see. In Fig. 2, they measure a tunneling rate on the order of a few tens of electrons per second, which corresponds to a tunneling current of 6.4aA. Ok. How do they do that? Obviously by using a QPC, but how does it work?...How would one measure the current going through the quantum dot directly? Putting between two leads ofcourse! How does thermal noise make that not work well? Is it because thermal energy makes electrons tunnel from one lead to another (direct tunnelling), or is it because thermal energy makes the electrons jump on the dot and out even when the level is not in the bias window, or is it a combination of both? This makes the number of in-tunnelling and out-tunnelling electrons blurred. Using a QPC -- with which we can detect the presence of a single electron --, however, the in-tunnelling and out-tunnelling current does not get obscured by thermal current that gives us no clue about the tunnelling ratios.</p>

<p> 5- Consider zero magnetic field. What are the three important energy scales in this experiment, and which of them is the largest? Why is it important that that energy scale be the largest in the experiment?: Charging energy, confinement energy, and thermal energy (?). Charging energy is around 1meV, which is much larger than the thermal energy in this experiment. This is necessary for maintaining the single electron tunneling regime. Estimating the confinement energy as planck's constant ^2 / (  (2* 0.06 * electron mass)  ) * (1 / 1000nm)^2 / electron charge = 25ueV, we say that the charging energy is the largest of the three.</p>

<p> 6- Explain the measuring principle behind this measurement set-up? What is the role of the QPC?: Electrons are flowing through the QPC. When an electron jumps on the dot, the current through the QPC drops sharply (if it's biased right...I should review the slides on the QPC to complete this answer...Also I should explain how the feedback mechanism works.).<\p>

<p> 7- Looking at Fig. 2, explain where the factor of 2 difference between in-tunneling current and out-tunnelling current comes from.:In the top-rightmost plot in Fig. 2, in-tunnelling current is twice as high as out-tunnelling current. This is because the lowest orbital can accomodate two electrons with opposite spin (spin singlet), so an electron will be twice as likely to tunnel onto the dot that if there were only place for one electron.</p> 



<h1>10th of December 2017</h1>
<p>As for the out-tunnelling current, the measurement in the paper is set up such that as soon as an electron tunnels in, the gate voltage is raised (through a feedback mechanism), and the it stays up until the electron on the dot jumps out. The out-tunnelling for the first level is small because only one electron is going to jump out. This results in the 2:1 ratio seen in the upper leftmost plot in Fig. 2. Now, when we add the second electron, it will land in the ground state, with a spin that is opposite to the spin of the electron already on the dot. The ground state, which can accomodate two electrons, already has one electron in it, and so has room for one more, i.e., the probability that an electron will tunnel is halved from when we were adding the first electron. As soon as the second electron jumps on, the feedback mechanism raises the gate energy and waits for the electrons to tunnel out. There are two of them so an electrons is twice as likley to tunnel out that it was to tunnel in, hence the 1:2 ratio between in-tunnelling and out-tunnelling current.</p>

<p> 8- What is the weak linear energy dependence mention in the paper?: From Fig. 2, we see that the tunneling rates are not constant as we vary the energy near the extremes. For a quantum dot with sharply defined energy levels, one would expect the tunneling rates to be constant: if the energy of the dot falls below that of the source, an electron will tunnel in with a certain probability that does not depend on how far below the source energy the dot energy is; and if dot energy goes above the drain energy, an electron will tunnel out with a certain probability, not matter how far above the drain energy the dot energy is. Where does the energy dependence come from, then? It comes from the fact that the tunnelling rate depends exponentially on the energy of the electron on and off the dot (Vds and Vgs), as can be seen from the WKB formula. For small variatons in the energies, the depends can be approximated by a linear model, which can be seen in the paper.</p>

<p> 9- What happens when we turn on a magnetic field? And how can this be seen from Fig. 3?: The spin degeneracy will be lifted, with a Zeeman energy splitting. This can be seen from Fig. 3 by seeing that at small negative energies, an electron is as likely to tunnel as it is to tunnel out, indicating that the lowest level can accomodate only one electron (with a spin parallel to the magnetic field). When the energy is made more negative such that the excited Zeeman level goes below the source energy, there is room for two electrons to tunnel in, which manifests as a two-fold increase in the in-tunneling rate.</p>

<p>------------------</p>

<p>Ok...on to something else.</p>

<h1>11th of December 2017</h1>
<p>I have had this picture for a while: quantum superposition comes from the inability (may be because otherwise something bad will happen -- in the same sense that an excited ion in a cavity does not emit a photon until the cavity is tuned to the right length, otherwise the photon will not fit in the cavity) of nature to distinguish between two states of something; like spin up or spin down of an electron, or horizontal electric field or vertical electric field of a photon, or right slit or left slit in a double-slit experiment. So what would go wrong with the universe if there were no superposition? Or...why is the universe unable to distinguish between the two states in a superposition?</p>

<p>There was this tweet that suggested that Sean Carroll endorses the idea that superposition comes from a universal limit on the transfer of information. This goes along the same lines of my thinking, so I am going to assume it's true for the sake of argument. There is a trend: things that can be in superpositon have a small mass (not small size <although small size might be making them more immune from interactions with the environment>), which is consistent with DeBorglie's matter wave idea \(\lambda = {h \over p} \); things that are observed to be in a superposition are ones that do not interact with too much stuff around them (collectively referred to as "the environment"); </p>

<h1>12th of December 2017</h1>
<p>An excited ion cannot relax in a cavity if the length is not an integer multiple of half the photon wavelength, because the photon will not fit. The photon cannot exist in the cavity so it will not be emitted. Now...an electron cannot go through a double-slit apparatus without being in a superposition. Before being observed, the electron cannot exist unless it's in a superposition. Why? What doesn't fit? What deadly fate is nature protecting the electron from?</p>

<p>Nature to itself when the excited-ion-in-a-cavity experiment is run: "No way I am going to let you emit that photon! The cavity length is not right! If I were a bouncer guarding the entrance of this cavity, I would never let that photon in. So you, ion, will NOT emit it."</p>

<p>Nature to itselft when an electron is going through a single slit: "Ok, electron. People would think that I would just let you land right infront of the slit. Unfortunately, your mass is too small, so [loud noise from a nearby construction site], and that's why I can't let you land in exactly one spot. You will have to diffract like a wave (but still land on a single spot on the detector screen)."</p>

<p>Me trying to guess what nature said: the electron mass is too small so...Does it have to do with the speed of light being the maximum speed of information transfer?...It's something that is affected by mass, because a more massive particle would not have to diffract as much an electron...What is the worst that could happen if the electron did not diffract? What forbidden thing would happen?</p>

<p>A photon has no mass, but its diffraction after a narrow slit can be varied by changing the photon's energy. So this is not stricly about mass. It is about energy...A photon still lands on a single spot on a detector screen after passing through a narrow slit. Will an electron with the same energy as a photon of a certain frequency diffract in exactly the same way? Well, wavelength is what determines how much a wave will diffract. Assuming that DeBroglie's formula is accurate, that means that for an electron wavelength \(\lambda_e\) and a photon wavelength \( \lambda_p \) to be equal, we must have \( {hc \over E} = {hc^2 \over E v_e}\). This equation only holds for \(v_e = c\), which is never true for an object with mass, which means that total energy is not everything; the momentum of the electron also matters. This doesn't look right, does it? For the photon I used \(\lambda_p = {hc \over E_p}  \), and for the electron I used \( \lambda_e = {h \over \gamma m_0 v} = {hc^2 \over E_e v}\). But this means that an electron will always have a longer wavelength as a photon, which I know is not true. Will come back to it later. In any case, we know that for photons, we can vary the diffraction by varying the frequency, and that the photon will always land on a single spot on a detector screen.</p>
