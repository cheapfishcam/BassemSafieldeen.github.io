<h1>30th of November 2017</h1>
<p>First entry.</p>


<h1>3rd of December 2017</h1>
<p>Reading <i>"Measuring the degeneracy of discrete energy levels using a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum
dot by Hofmann et al." </i>:
What is "detailed balance"? </p>
 
<p>I went over the paper. Still need to really understand everything and be able to answer the questions in the exercise.</p>

<h1>8th of December 2017</h1>
<p>Ok..back to the problem set: </p>

<p> 1- What is the Stark effect?: It's an energy splitting due to an applied electric field which pulls electrons and the nuclei to which they are attached in different directions. This has the effect that an electronic state in which the electron tends to reside more on the left of the nucleus, it will have a lower energy than an electron that tends to reside on the right. What does this have to do with the paper? The authors of the paper propose a technique of measure the different kinds of degeneracies without lifting them. The experiments focus on spin-degeneracy.</p>

<p> 2- Draw a circuit diagram of the set-up in Fig. 1a, with all voltage sources, current meters, and ground: I will be able to answer this one more easily after I understand how the experiment works exactly; will come back to it later... </p>

<p> 3- Why is the measured current in Fig. 1b for the (N-1) occupation greater than for the N occupation?: So when an extra electron is on the dot, the current through the quantum point contact (QPC) is lower. A QPC is just a current channel that we can make narrower by varying the voltage of the top gates defining it. In this case, we can think of the quantum dot as one of the top gates. When an extra electron is on the dot, it makes the channel narrower because it repels the electrons under it.  So there you go. That's what happens qualitatively. Can we make it more quantitative? We always can; but is it worth it? </p>

<p> 4- In a traditional measurement set-up, in which the current through the quantum dot is measured directly, the noise limits the sensitivity of the measurement, with 30fA usually considered to be the lower limit. Why can the guys in this paper measure a much smaller current? [Hint: for 100fA how many electrons move through the dot per second, i.e., what is the corresponding tunneling rate?]: In Fig. 1b, they measure 1.46nA when the dot is empty and 1.21nA when the dot has an electron on it. Where is fA? Let's answer the question in the hint, first. I = Ne/t = 100fA. This gives a tunnelling rate (\(\Gamma\) ?) N/t of 624150.9647 electrons per second. Oh..I see. In Fig. 2, they measure a tunneling rate on the order of a few tens of electrons per second, which corresponds to a tunneling current of 6.4aA. Ok. How do they do that? Obviously by using a QPC, but how does it work?...How would one measure the current going through the quantum dot directly? Putting between two leads ofcourse! How does thermal noise make that not work well? Is it because thermal energy makes electrons tunnel from one lead to another (direct tunnelling), or is it because thermal energy makes the electrons jump on the dot and out even when the level is not in the bias window, or is it a combination of both? This makes the number of in-tunnelling and out-tunnelling electrons blurred. Using a QPC -- with which we can detect the presence of a single electron --, however, the in-tunnelling and out-tunnelling current does not get obscured by thermal current that gives us no clue about the tunnelling ratios.</p>

<p> 5- Consider zero magnetic field. What are the three important energy scales in this experiment, and which of them is the largest? Why is it important that that energy scale be the largest in the experiment?: Charging energy, confinement energy, and splitting energy (?). The confinement energy has to be greater than the charging energy so that we can resolve single energy levels and measure the spin degenracy.</p>

<p> 6- Explain the measuring principle behind this measurement set-up? What is the role of the QPC?: Electrons are flowing through the QPC. When an electron jumps on the dot, the current through the QPC drops sharply (if it's biased right...I should review the slides on the QPC to complete this answer...Also I should explain how the feedback mechanism works.). <\p>

<p> 7- Looking at Fig. 2, explain where the factor of 2 difference between in-tunneling current and out-tunnelling current comes from.:In the top-rightmost plot in Fig. 2, in-tunnelling current is twice as high as out-tunnelling current.  <\p>
