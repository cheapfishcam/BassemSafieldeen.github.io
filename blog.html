<h1>30th of November 2017</h1>
<p>First entry</p>


<h1>3rd of December 2017</h1>
<p>Reading <i>"Measuring the degeneracy of discrete energy levels using a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum
dot by Hofmann et al." </i>:
What is "detailed balance"? </p>
 
<p>I went over the paper. Still need to really understand everything and be able to answer the questions in the exercise.</p>

<p>Ok..back to the problem set: </p>

<p> 1- What is the Stark effect?: It's an energy splitting due to an applied electric field which pulls electrons and the nuclei to which they are attached in different directions. This has the effect that an electronic state in which the electron tends to reside more on the left of the nucleus, it will have a lower energy than an electron that tends to reside on the right. What does this have to do with the paper? The authors of the paper propose a technique of measure the different kinds of degeneracies without lifting them. The experiments focus on spin-degeneracy.</p>

<p> 2- Draw a circuit diagram of the set-up in Fig. 1a, with all voltage sources, current meters, and ground: I will be able to answer this one more easily after I understand how the experiment works exactly; will come back to it later... </p>

<p> 3- Why is the measured current in Fig. 1b for the (N-1) occupation greater than for the N occupation?: So when an extra electron is on the dot, the current through the quantum point contact (QPC) is lower. A QPC is just a current channel that we can make narrower by varying the voltage of the top gates defining it. In this case, we can think of the quantum dot as one of the top gates. When an extra electron is on the dot, it makes the channel narrower because it repels the electrons under it.  So there you go. That's what happens qualitatively. Can we make it more quantitative? We always can, but is it worth it? </p>

<p> 4- In a traditional measurement set-up, in which the current through the quantum dot is measured directly, the noise limits the sensitivity of the measurement, with 30fA usually considered to be the lower limit. Why can the guys in this paper measure a much smaller current? [Hint: for 100fA how many electrons move through the dot per second, i.e., what is the corresponding tunneling rate?]: In Fig. 1b, they measure 1.46nA when the dot is empty and 1.21nA when the dot has an electron on it. Where is fA? Let's answer the question in the hint, first. I = Ne/t = 100fA. This gives a tunneling rate ($\Gamma$ ?) N/t of </p>
